``pyprep`` is a Python implementation of the
`Preprocessing Pipeline (PREP) <https://doi.org/10.3389/fninf.2015.00016>`_
for EEG data, working with `MNE-Python <https://mne.tools>`_.

**ALPHA SOFTWARE.**
**This package is currently in its early stages of iteration.**
**It may change both its internals or its user-facing API in the near future.**
**Any feedback and ideas on how to improve either of these is welcome!**
**Use this software at your own risk.**

Installation
============

``pyprep`` requires Python version ``3.7`` or higher to run properly.
We recommend to run ``pyprep`` in a dedicated virtual environment
(for example using `conda <https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html>`_).

For installing the **stable** version of ``pyprep``, call:

.. code-block:: Text

   pip install pyprep

or, as an alternative to ``pip``, call:

.. code-block:: Text

   conda install -c conda-forge pyprep

For installing the **latest (development)** version of ``pyprep``, call:

.. code-block:: Text

   pip install git+https://github.com/sappelhoff/pyprep.git@master


Both the *stable* and the *latest* installation will additionally install
all required dependencies automatically.
The dependencies are defined in the ``setup.cfg`` file under the
``options.install_requires`` section.
