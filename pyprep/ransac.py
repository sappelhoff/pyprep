    """Detect channels that are not predicted well by other channels.

    Here, a RANSAC approach (see [1]_, and a short discussion in [2]_) is
    adopted to predict a "clean EEG" dataset. After identifying clean EEG
    channels through the other methods, the clean EEG dataset is
    constructed by repeatedly sampling a small subset of clean EEG channels
    and interpolation the complete data. The median of all those
    repetitions forms the clean EEG dataset. In a second step, the original
    and the RANSAC-predicted data are correlated and channels, which do not
    correlate well with themselves across the two datasets are considered
    `bad_by_ransac`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    data : np.ndarray
        A 2-D array of detrended EEG data, with bad-by-flat and bad-by-NaN
        channels removed.
    sample_rate : float
        The sample rate (in Hz) of the EEG data.
    complete_chn_labs : array_like
        Labels for all channels in `data`, in the same order as they appear
        in `data`.
    chn_pos : np.ndarray
        3-D electrode coordinates for all channels in `data`, in the same order
        as they appear in `data`.
    exclude : list
        Labels of channels to exclude as signal predictors during RANSAC
        (i.e., channels already flagged as bad by metrics other than HF noise).
    n_samples : int, optional
        Number of random channel samples to use for RANSAC. Defaults to ``50``.
    sample_prop : float, optional
        Proportion of total channels to use for signal prediction per RANSAC
        sample. This needs to be in the range [0, 1], where 0 would mean no
        channels would be used and 1 would mean all channels would be used
        (neither of which would be useful values). Defaults to ``0.25`` (e.g.,
        16 channels per sample for a 64-channel dataset).
    corr_thresh : float, optional
        The minimum predicted vs. actual signal correlation for a channel to
        be considered good within a given RANSAC window. Defaults to ``0.75``.
    fraction_bad : float, optional
        The minimum fraction of bad (i.e., below-threshold) RANSAC windows for a
        channel to be considered bad-by-RANSAC. Defaults to ``0.4``.
    corr_window_secs : float, optional
        The duration (in seconds) of each RANSAC correlation window. Defaults to
        5 seconds.
    channel_wise : bool, optional
        Whether RANSAC should be performed one channel at a time (lower RAM
        demands) or in chunks of as many channels as can fit into the currently
        available RAM (faster). Defaults to ``False`` (i.e., using the faster
        method).
    random_state : {int, None, np.random.RandomState}, optional
        The random seed with which to generate random samples of channels during
        RANSAC. If random_state is an int, it will be used as a seed for RandomState.
        If ``None``, the seed will be obtained from the operating system
        (see RandomState for details). Defaults to ``None``.
    matlab_strict : bool, optional
        Whether or not RANSAC should strictly follow MATLAB PREP's internal
        math, ignoring any improvements made in PyPREP over the original code
        (see :ref:`matlab-diffs` for more details). Defaults to ``False``.

    Returns
    -------
    bad_by_ransac : list
        List containing the labels of all channels flagged as bad by RANSAC.
    channel_correlations : np.ndarray
        Array of shape (windows, channels) containing the correlations of
        the channels with their predicted RANSAC values for each window.
