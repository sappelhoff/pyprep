Bug
~~~

- In find_noisy_channels the signal detrend was accidentally undone which destabilized the RANSAC.
- The detrend is now done over the NoisyChannels.raw_mne object to avoid this and to force that any signal in there is detrended like in matlab's prep.
- Included a boolean which indicates if detrend should be done internally or not for the use of find_noisy_channels in reference.py


Changelog
~~~~~~~~~

- Robust average referencing + tests by  `Victor Xiang`_
- Removing trend in the EEG data by high pass filtering and local linear regression + tests `Aamna Lawrence`_
- Finding noisy channels with comparable output to Matlab +tests-including test for ransac `Aamna Lawrence`_
- Stringing all the things together for the PREP pipeline +tests `Victor Xiang`_
- Finding noisy channels with comparable output to Matlab +tests-including test for ransac `Aamna Lawrence`_
- Finding the appropriate parameters in the MNE notch filter for implementing clean line noise functionality of Eeglab `Aamna Lawrence`_
- Finding the reason for the difference between the Matlab and Pyprepâ€™s output- Probably minor differences in the filter functions and also rounding done by functions like quantile `Victor Xiang`_  and `Aamna Lawrence`_
- Overall debugging `Victor Xiang`_  and `Aamna Lawrence`_

API
~~~

- Oversaw modularization of PREP pipeline's submodules and a scikit learn style :func:`pyprep.fit` by `Adam Li`_
- Oversaw ChangeLog by `Victor Xiang`_  and `Aamna Lawrence`_ for transitioning pyPrep to Version 0.3.0 by `Adam Li`_
