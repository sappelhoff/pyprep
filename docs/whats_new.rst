Changelog
~~~~~~~~~
- Added two attributes :attr:`PrepPipeline.noisy_channels_before_interpolation` and :attr:`PrepPipeline.noisy_channels_after_interpolation` which have the detailed output of each noisy criteria, by `Yorguin Mantilla`_ (`#45 <https://github.com/sappelhoff/pyprep/pull/45>`_)
- Added two keys to the :attr:`PrepPipeline.noisy_channels_original` dictionary: ``bad_by_dropout`` and ``bad_by_SNR``, by `Yorguin Mantilla`_ (`#45 <https://github.com/sappelhoff/pyprep/pull/45>`_)
- Changed RANSAC chunking logic to reduce max memory use and prefer equal chunk sizes where possible, by `Austin Hurst`_ (`#44 <https://github.com/sappelhoff/pyprep/pull/44>`_)

Bug
~~~
- Fixed RANSAC to give consistent results with a fixed seed across different chunk sizes, by `Austin Hurst`_ and `Yorguin Mantilla`_ (`#43 <https://github.com/sappelhoff/pyprep/pull/43>`_)

API
~~~
- The permissible parameters for the following methods were removed and/or reordered: :meth:`NoisyChannels.ransac_correlations`, :meth:`NoisyChannels.run_ransac`, and :meth:`NoisyChannels.get_ransac_pred` methods, by `Austin Hurst`_ and `Yorguin Mantilla`_ (`#43 <https://github.com/sappelhoff/pyprep/pull/43>`_)

Version 0.3.1
-------------

Changelog
~~~~~~~~~
- It's now possible to pass keyword arguments to the notch filter inside prep; see the ``filter_kwargs`` parameter by `Yorguin Mantilla`_ (`#40 <https://github.com/sappelhoff/pyprep/pull/40>`_)
- The default filter length for the spectrum_fit method will be '10s' to fix memory issues, by `Yorguin Mantilla`_ (`#40 <https://github.com/sappelhoff/pyprep/pull/40>`_)
- Channel types  are now available from a new ``ch_types_all`` attribute, and non-EEG channel names are now available from a new ``ch_names_non_eeg`` attribute from :class:`pyprep.PrepPipeline`, by `Yorguin Mantilla`_ (`#34 <https://github.com/sappelhoff/pyprep/pull/34>`_)
- Renaming of ``ch_names`` attribute of ``PrepPipeline`` to ``ch_names_all``, by `Yorguin Mantilla`_ (`#34 <https://github.com/sappelhoff/pyprep/pull/34>`_)
- It's now possible to pass ``'eeg'`` to ``ref_chs`` and ``reref_chs`` parameters to select only eeg channels for referencing, by `Yorguin Mantilla`_ (`#34 <https://github.com/sappelhoff/pyprep/pull/34>`_)
- Prep will retain the non eeg channels through the ``raw`` attribute. The eeg-only and non-eeg parts will be in raw_eeg and raw_non_eeg respectively. See the ``raw`` attribute, by `Christian Oreilly`_ (`#34 <https://github.com/sappelhoff/pyprep/pull/34>`_)
- When a ransac call needs more memory than available, pyprep will now automatically switch to a slower but less memory-consuming version of ransac. See the ``channel_wise`` parameter, by `Yorguin Mantilla`_ (`#32 <https://github.com/sappelhoff/pyprep/pull/32>`_)
- It's now possible to pass an empty list for the ``line_freqs`` param in ``PrepPipeline`` to skip the line noise removal, by `Yorguin Mantilla`_ (`#29 <https://github.com/sappelhoff/pyprep/pull/29>`_)
- The three main classes ``PrepPipeline``, ``NoisyChannels``, and ``Reference`` now have a ``random_state`` parameter to set a seed that gets passed on to all their internal methods and class calls, by `Stefan Appelhoff`_ (`#31 <https://github.com/sappelhoff/pyprep/pull/31>`_)


Bug
~~~

- Corrected inconsistentcy of :mod:`reference` with the matlab version (`#19 <https://github.com/sappelhoff/pyprep/issues/19>`_), by `Yorguin Mantilla`_ (`#32 <https://github.com/sappelhoff/pyprep/pull/32>`_)
- Prevented an over detrending in :mod:`reference`, by `Yorguin Mantilla`_ (`#32 <https://github.com/sappelhoff/pyprep/pull/32>`_)


API
~~~

- Remove ``noisy.py`` module from the ``pyprep`` package. Its main functionality has been migrated to the remaining modules, and the functions for FASTER have been dropped because they were out of scope, by `Stefan Appelhoff`_ (`#39 <https://github.com/sappelhoff/pyprep/pull/39>`_)

- Robust average referencing + tests, by  `Victor Xiang`_ (`#6 <https://github.com/sappelhoff/pyprep/pull/6>`_)

- Finding the reason for the difference between the Matlab and Pyprepâ€™s output- Probably minor differences in the filter functions and also rounding done by functions like quantile, by `Victor Xiang`_  and `Aamna Lawrence`_ (`#6 <https://github.com/sappelhoff/pyprep/pull/6>`_)
