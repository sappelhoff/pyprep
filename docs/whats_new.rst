Changelog
~~~~~~~~~
- Created a new module named :mod:`ransac` which contains :func:`find_bad_by_ransac <ransac.find_bad_by_ransac>`,  a standalone function mirroring the previous ransac method from the :class:`NoisyChannels` class, by `Yorguin Mantilla`_ (:gh:`51`)
- Added two attributes :attr:`PrepPipeline.noisy_channels_before_interpolation <prep_pipeline.PrepPipeline>` and :attr:`PrepPipeline.noisy_channels_after_interpolation <prep_pipeline.PrepPipeline>` which have the detailed output of each noisy criteria, by `Yorguin Mantilla`_ (:gh:`45`)
- Added two keys to the :attr:`PrepPipeline.noisy_channels_original <prep_pipeline.PrepPipeline>` dictionary: ``bad_by_dropout`` and ``bad_by_SNR``, by `Yorguin Mantilla`_ (:gh:`45`)
- Changed RANSAC chunking logic to reduce max memory use and prefer equal chunk sizes where possible, by `Austin Hurst`_ (:gh:`44`)

Bug
~~~
- Fixed RANSAC to give consistent results with a fixed seed across different chunk sizes, by `Austin Hurst`_ and `Yorguin Mantilla`_ (:gh:`43`)
- Fixed "bad channel by flat" threshold in :meth:`NoisyChannels.find_bad_by_nan_flat` to be consistent with MATLAB PREP, by `Austin Hurst`_ (:gh:`60`)
- Changed "bad channel by deviation" and "bad channel by correlation" detection code in :class:`NoisyChannels` to compute IQR and quantiles in the same manner as MATLAB, thus producing identical results to MATLAB PREP, by `Austin Hurst`_ (:gh:`57`)

API
~~~
- The permissible parameters for the following methods were removed and/or reordered: :func:`ransac.ransac_correlations`, :func:`ransac.run_ransac`, and :func:`ransac.get_ransac_pred` methods, by `Yorguin Mantilla`_ (:gh:`51`)
- The following methods have been moved to a new module named :mod:`ransac` and are now private: :meth:`NoisyChannels.ransac_correlations`, :meth:`NoisyChannels.run_ransac <find_noisy_channels.NoisyChannels.run_ransac>`, and :meth:`NoisyChannels.get_ransac_pred <find_noisy_channels.NoisyChannels.get_ransac_pred>` methods, by `Yorguin Mantilla`_ (:gh:`51`)
- The permissible parameters for the following methods were removed and/or reordered: :meth:`NoisyChannels.ransac_correlations <find_noisy_channels.NoisyChannels.ransac_correlations>`, :meth:`NoisyChannels.run_ransac`, and :meth:`NoisyChannels.get_ransac_pred <find_noisy_channels.NoisyChannels.get_ransac_pred>` methods, by `Austin Hurst`_ and `Yorguin Mantilla`_ (:gh:`43`)

.. _changes_0_3_1:

Version 0.3.1
-------------

Changelog
~~~~~~~~~
- It's now possible to pass keyword arguments to the notch filter inside :class:`PrepPipeline <prep_pipeline.PrepPipeline>`; see the ``filter_kwargs`` parameter by `Yorguin Mantilla`_ (:gh:`40`)
- The default filter length for the spectrum_fit method will be '10s' to fix memory issues, by `Yorguin Mantilla`_ (:gh:`40`)
- Channel types  are now available from a new ``ch_types_all`` attribute, and non-EEG channel names are now available from a new ``ch_names_non_eeg`` attribute from :class:`PrepPipeline <prep_pipeline.PrepPipeline>`, by `Yorguin Mantilla`_ (:gh:`34`)
- Renaming of ``ch_names`` attribute of :class:`PrepPipeline <prep_pipeline.PrepPipeline>` to ``ch_names_all``, by `Yorguin Mantilla`_ (:gh:`34`)
- It's now possible to pass ``'eeg'`` to ``ref_chs`` and ``reref_chs`` keywords to the ``prep_params`` parameter of :class:`PrepPipeline <prep_pipeline.PrepPipeline>` to select only eeg channels for referencing, by `Yorguin Mantilla`_ (:gh:`34`)
- :class:`PrepPipeline <prep_pipeline.PrepPipeline>` will retain the non eeg channels through the ``raw`` attribute. The eeg-only and non-eeg parts will be in raw_eeg and raw_non_eeg respectively. See the ``raw`` attribute, by `Christian Oreilly`_ (:gh:`34`)
- When a ransac call needs more memory than available, pyprep will now automatically switch to a slower but less memory-consuming version of ransac, by `Yorguin Mantilla`_ (:gh:`32`)
- It's now possible to pass an empty list for the ``line_freqs`` param in :class:`PrepPipeline <prep_pipeline.PrepPipeline>` to skip the line noise removal, by `Yorguin Mantilla`_ (:gh:`29`)
- The three main classes :class:`PrepPipeline <prep_pipeline.PrepPipeline>`, :class:`NoisyChannels <find_noisy_channels.NoisyChannels>`, and :class:`Reference <reference.Reference>` now have a ``random_state`` parameter to set a seed that gets passed on to all their internal methods and class calls, by `Stefan Appelhoff`_ (:gh:`31`)


Bug
~~~

- Corrected inconsistency of :mod:`reference` module with the matlab version (:gh:`19`), by `Yorguin Mantilla`_ (:gh:`32`)
- Prevented an over detrending in :mod:`reference` module, by `Yorguin Mantilla`_ (:gh:`32`)


API
~~~

- Remove ``noisy.py`` module from the ``pyprep`` package. Its main functionality has been migrated to the remaining modules, and the functions for FASTER have been dropped because they were out of scope, by `Stefan Appelhoff`_ (:gh:`39`)

.. _changes_0_3_0:

Version 0.3.0
-------------

Changelog
~~~~~~~~~

- Include a boolean ``do_detrend`` in :meth:`Reference.robust_reference <reference.Reference>` to indicate whether detrend should be done internally or not for the use with :mod:`find_noisy_channels` module, by `Yorguin Mantilla`_ (:gh:`9`)
- Robust average referencing + tests, by  `Victor Xiang`_ (:gh:`6`)
- Removing trend in the EEG data by high pass filtering and local linear regression + tests, by `Aamna Lawrence`_ (:gh:`6`)
- Finding noisy channels with comparable output to Matlab + tests-including test for ransac, by `Aamna Lawrence`_ (:gh:`6`)
- Stringing all the things together for the PREP pipeline + tests, by `Victor Xiang`_ (:gh:`6`)
- Finding noisy channels with comparable output to Matlab + tests-including test for ransac, by `Aamna Lawrence`_ (:gh:`6`)
- Finding the appropriate parameters in the MNE notch filter for implementing clean line noise functionality of Eeglab, by `Aamna Lawrence`_ (:gh:`6`)
- Finding the reason for the difference between the Matlab and Pyprepâ€™s output- Probably minor differences in the filter functions and also rounding done by functions like quantile, by `Victor Xiang`_  and `Aamna Lawrence`_ (:gh:`6`)

Bug
~~~
